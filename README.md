Welcome to the AWS CodeStar sample web service
==============================================

This sample code helps get you started with a simple Python web service using
AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.

What's Here
-----------

This sample includes:

* README.md - this file
* buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to package your
  application for deployment to AWS Lambda
* risk_handler.py - this file contains the sample Python code for the web service
* template.yml - this file contains the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) used
  by AWS CloudFormation to deploy your application to AWS Lambda and Amazon API
  Gateway.
* tests/ - this directory contains unit tests for your application


What Do I Do Next?
------------------

If you have checked out a local copy of your repository you can start making changes
to the sample code.  We suggest making a small change to risk_handler.py first, so you can
see how changes pushed to your project's repository are automatically picked up by your
project pipeline and deployed to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. (You can watch the pipeline
progress on your AWS CodeStar project dashboard.)Once you've seen how that works,
start developing your own code, and have fun!

To run your tests locally, go to the root directory of the 
sample code and run the `python -m unittest discover tests` command, which
AWS CodeBuild also runs through your `buildspec.yml` file.

To test your new code during the release process, modify the existing tests or 
add tests to the tests directory. AWS CodeBuild will run the tests during the 
build stage of your project pipeline. You can find the test results
in the AWS CodeBuild console.
